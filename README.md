```

## How to use

```js
import { yo } from 'yoo-hoo';

yo('GOOD');
```

## API

```typescript

yo(text: string, options?: Option): string[]
```

**Options:**

- spacing: `number`  The number of spacing between two characters. Default `1`.
- maxLineWidth: `number`  The max length of lines. If exceed `maxLineWidth` following characters will get a line feed. Default `Infinity`.
- color: `string`  Setting the color for print. Default `none`. There contains several values:

For example,

```typescript
yo('ho', { color: 'blue' });
```
